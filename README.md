Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)
Results:
  The purpose of this analysis was to predict whether or not someone would pay their credit card bills on time using a multi-factor approach. Over 100 different attributes per card holder were considered (employment data, home ownership, purpose, zip code, etc...).

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)
